ICaaS (Image Creation as a Service) is a service to be used in combination with
a `Synnefo <https://www.synnefo.org/>`_ deployment to easily import and
register external OS Images on it. The main source of OS images that ICaaS
works with is the `Bitnami <https://bitnami.com>`_ Project. With the use of
ICaaS, the Synnefo users can easily deploy VMs that have a great variety of
freely available, high quality, open source web applications pre-installed.

The service is developed in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ using the
`Flask <https://flask.pocoo.org>`_ microframework and it heavily depends on the
`ICaaS Agent <https://www.synnefo.org/docs/icaas-agent/latest/>`_ software
which is developed independently. For more info about the ICaaS architecture,
see below.
