ICaaS - Image Creator as a Service
==================================

ICaaS is a Python Flask application meant to provide the functionality of
[snf-image-creator](https://www.synnefo.org/docs/snf-image-creator) as a
service, through the use of [Synnefo](https://synnefo.org) VMs.

For the time being, it only works on [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/) images.
